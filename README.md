# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a movie recommendation system built using content-based filtering. The goal is to recommend movies similar to a given movie based on its features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords. The recommendation system uses cosine similarity to compute the closeness between movies, which is then used to suggest similar movies.
