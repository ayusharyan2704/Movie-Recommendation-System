# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project is a movie recommendation system built using content-based filtering. The goal is to recommend movies similar to a given movie based on its features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords. The recommendation system uses cosine similarity to compute the closeness between movies, which is then used to suggest similar movies.

## Approach

### 1. Data Loading:
The dataset used in this project is from **TMDb (The Movie Database)**, containing two files: `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`. These files contain information about movies such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Merging both datasets to have all necessary information in one place.
- Extracting relevant features like **genres**, **keywords**, **cast**, and **crew** for building a movie profile.
- Using text processing techniques to transform the extracted features into a suitable format (e.g., converting strings into lists of individual components, lowering case, and removing spaces).

### 3. Feature Engineering:
- Selecting important features for recommendation:
  - **Genres**: What type of movie it is.
  - **Keywords**: Important plot points or characteristics.
  - **Cast**: Who acted in the movie.
  - **Crew**: Who directed the movie.
- Combining these features to create a single text-based profile for each movie.

### 4. Building the Recommendation Engine:
- Using the **CountVectorizer** from scikit-learn to convert the text data into a matrix of token counts.
- Computing the **cosine similarity** between the movie vectors. This gives a similarity score between any two movies.

### 5. Recommendation Function:
- Given a movie, the system retrieves its corresponding vector and computes its similarity with all other movies.
- Sorting the similarity scores and recommending the top `n` similar movies.

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the data was necessary to ensure accurate recommendations.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting useful features from text-based data was crucial for creating meaningful movie profiles.
- **Performance**: As the number of movies increased, the time complexity of computing pairwise similarity grew, making optimization crucial for large datasets.

## Key Takeaways
- **Text Processing**: Successfully applied text processing techniques to extract relevant information from raw movie descriptions.
- **Recommendation System**: Learned the working of a content-based recommendation system using cosine similarity.
- **Scalability**: A major focus was ensuring the system could handle large datasets efficiently.

## Future Improvements
- **Hybrid Model**: Combining content-based filtering with collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.
- **Personalization**: Incorporating user behavior (e.g., user ratings) for better personalization.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the recommendation system as a web service using Flask or Streamlit.
